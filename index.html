      <h3>True Freeze is DeFi's first patience primitive.</h3>
      <p> Price volatility is a key blocker to broader crypto adoption. Holding assets that
        can go up and down double digit percentages all within the same month is too
        stressful for many regular people. </p>
      <p>It's hard to HODL and you don't get paid to do it- <strong>until now</strong>.
        True Freeze tokenizes patience. Allowing the market to form a baseline
        rate of return for people to lock their assets out of circulation.</p>

      <h3>True Freeze is a public good.</h3>

      <p>Bitcoin was launched and left. It was entrusted to the community with no centralized
        control or admin privileges. It doesn't have a DAO nor a governance token. It
        is a trustless mechanism of turning energy into value (proof of work).</p>
      <p>True Freeze is a similar public good. Launched and left to function on its own for
        hundreds of years with no governance, emergency powers, or admin controls.
        A trustless mechanism for turning holding into value. (proof of patience). </p>

      <h3>True Freeze is composable.</h3>
      <p>Any protocol, DAO, fund, or person(s) with ETH
        (or other asset when True Freeze is duplicated on other chains, e.g. MATIC on Polygon)
        can confirm on-chain a commitment to lock their funds out of the market for a period of time.
        In exchange they mint Freezer ETH (frETH) the yield token and a Freezer NFT
        serving as a Certificate of Deposit.</p>

      <img class="center-img" src="images/FreezerNFT_100wETH.svg" alt="" width="250px">
      <br>
      <p>This Freezer NFT can be bought/sold on any NFT marketplace,
        acting similar to an on-chain zero-coupon bond.</p>

      <h3>True Freeze is risk-minimized defi.</h3>

      <p> True Freeze does <em>nothing</em> with deposits.
        It is <strong>not</strong> forwarded to a yield farm or staked or paired with
        any other asset for liquidity fees.
        There are <strong>no</strong> price oracles or liquidations.
        It is as close as possible to cold storage, but with yield.</p>

      <p>
        This is a critical point. Many people's first reaction to this design is,
        "why not double-dip and use [insert strategy] to get more yield". This is a
        fundamental misundertanding of finance. The goal of a financial portfolio is
        to maximize <em>risk-adjusted</em> returns. In traditional finance markets we
        see that lower risk is often lower return, but, with lower risks also comes a
        a larger market. </p>

        <img class="center-img img-top" src="images/addressable_market2.svg">
      </div>
      <p>True Freeze risk-minimized DeFi can serve as an on-ramp to the
        10s of millions of Ether held by people who have never used a smart contract before.
      </p>

      <h3>Vocabulary</h3>
      <div class="vocab-table">
        <img src="images/vocab_table.png" alt="">
      </div>
      <h3>Deposit</h3>
      <p>Users deposit ETH and specify how long they are willing to commit to locking
        it out of circulation.</p>
      <p>For example, here someone deposits 100 ETH for 2 Years.</p>
      <img class="center-img" src="images/FreezerNFT_100wETH.svg" alt="" width="250px">
      <h3>Freezer Yield Token</h3>
      <p>They receive 1 freezer ETH (frETH) per ETH per Year. Here,
        100 ETH locked out of circulation on January 20th, 2022 for
        2 years (until January 20th 2024) mints 200 frETH.</p>
      <h3>Freezer NFT</h3>
      <p>The user also receives a Certicate of Deposit represented by
        the Freezer NFT. This NFT is a fully on-chain ERC721 NFT with no reliance
        on external file storage for the image or metadata. This NFT is tradeable
        on any NFT marketplace and is a 1 to 1 representation of ETH locked in True Freeze.</p>
      <h3>Redemption</h3>
      <p>Anyone holding a Freezer NFT can redeem the NFT to withdraw the corresponding ETH
        in True Freeze with 0 fees after the Maturity Date.</p>

      <p>Note: Redemption prior to the maturity date, charges <strong>2 fees:</strong>
        a 0.25% ETH penalty and a frETH fee. (possibly more than minted!)</p>
      <img class="center-img" src="images/frETH_yield_curve.svg" alt="">
      <p>On the lock date, an immediate withdrawal requires a fee of 20% more frETH than minted.
        So on the 100 ETH NFT example, withdrawal on Jan 20, 2022 would require 1.2 * 200 = 240 frETH, in
        addition to a 0.0025 * 100 = 0.25 ETH penalty. The fee falls every day, falling
        more in the final 3rd of the lock duration, until you can withdraw on or after the maturity date for
        no frETH fees and no ETH penalty.</p>

      <h3>Freezer Revenue Token</h3>
      <p>
        50% of frETH fees above the original amount minted (rest burned) and
        100% of ETH penalties go to stakers of the Freezer Revenue Token (FRZ).
        To incentivize continual use of the True Freeze ecosystem, the FRZ token supply is inflationary.
        In the first year, the FRZ supply will inflate by 10%. The next year 9%. Each year the
        inflation rate falls until the 10 year. After year 10 and <em>forever after</em> it will
        inflate at 2% per year.
      </p>
      <div class="card">
        <img class src="images/FRZ_supply_growth1.svg" alt="">
        <img class="img-top" src="images/FRZ_supply_growth2.svg" alt="">
      </div>
      <p> This 10 year Accumulation Phase of high inflation bootstraps use of the protocol so that
        continued active use of the ecosystem is rewarded more than simply receiving the airdrop and not
        using the primitive.</p>

      <p> FRZ is primarily earned by <strong>burning</strong> frETH. Forever after, new FRZ minted each year
        is shared proportionally among everyone who has burned frETH in the history of the protocol.
        This creates a competitive mechanism for protocols to integrate True Freeze into their
        yield strategies and continuously earn & burn frETH, receive FRZ, and stake it for frETH fees and ETH penalties.</p>

      <h2 id="tokenomics">Tokenomics</h2>
      <h3>Finance Context</h3>
      <p>Certificates of Deposit are low risk investments available at banks
        globally. Although this low risk often means lower returns relative to stocks and other investments,
        they are a popular part of many financial portfolios.</p>

      <p>The True Freeze ecosystem rewards creating and trading CDs with
        market determined interest rates (the frETH yield token's value) and community owned revenue
        (the fees and penalties paid to FRZ stakers). </p>

      <p>For trading Freeer NFTs, zero-coupon bond pricing is applicable. In traditional
        finance a zero coupon bond is an investment that pays its amount (par value) at maturity, but does not
        pay interest along the way. Thus these bonds trade <em>below</em> their par value. The difference in
        price paid and the par value is the <em>implicit</em> return. For example, if you pay $95 for a bond
        that gives you $100 in 1 year; then you earned $5 in returns (5/95 = 5.2%).</p>

      <p>This a core innovation of True Freeze - the ability to buy ETH with ETH profitably.</p>

      <h3>Freezer Yield Token</h3>
      <p>frETH, the yield token minted for creating Freezer NFTs, allows for new profitable
        ways for those interested in low risk (no oracles, no impermanent loss, no liquidations) DeFi
        to earn from confirming their patience on-chain.</p>

      <p>Using the Freezer NFT example above, imagine Alice locks 100 ETH for 2 years and mints 200 frETH.
        Bob is willing to buy Alice's CD for 95 ETH, securing a (5 / 95 = 5.2%) implicit return on ETH over 2 years.
        Alice can profitably accept that trade as long as 200 frETH > (5 ETH + any related transaction costs).</p>
      <p> If 1 frETH = 0.04 ETH, then 200 frETH = 8 ETH. She can profit nearly 3 ETH from this trade. </p>

      <p>Note, in this case, Bob could lock his 95 ETH for 1.32 Years, receive 125 frETH and sell that for 5 ETH and
        be better off. The economic theory is that the appropriate price for these Freezer NFTs change with frETH's price
        in ETH. Changes in the market price of frETH represent changing time preferences for ETH. At full maturity,
        frETH absorbs the volatility of ETH and becomes the benchmark rate for all of ETH related DeFi!</p>

      <h3>Freezer Revenue Token</h3>
      <p>The FRZ revenue token acts as just like a stock receiving dividends. It's value will
        fluctuate as people forecast fees and penalties from early withdrawals. To support long term
        use of True Freeze, FRZ inflates, so that staker's percent of revenue ownership falls over time. To keep up,
        stakers must compete to burn frETH and retain their percent of newly minted FRZ earned.</p>

      <h3>Flywheel</h3>
      <p>The True Freeze Ecosystem has multiple counteracting effects for changes in
        the market price of ETH and frETH. There are 7 core principles underlying this flywheel:</p>
      <div class="center-img">
        <div class="custom-list">
          <p>1. Lower frETH prices means lower early withdrawal costs in ETH terms.</p>
          <p>2. When early withdrawals cost less, more of them happen, leading to revenue to FRZ stakers.</p>
          <p>3. More revenue to FRZ stakers combined with lower frETH prices means more frETH burned to earn FRZ.</p>
          <p>4. 1 frETH burned = 1 ETH out of circulation for 1 year, reducing the circulation of ETH.</p>
          <p>5. With less ETH in circulation, its price rises (assuming demand does not change),
            which leads to more early withdrawals (to sell ETH high and rebuy it low).</p>
          <p>6. To withdraw ETH early requires frETH, so the price of frETH rises.</p>
          <p>7. When frETH rises, the benefits of locking ETH rises, so more people lock ETH and sell frETH; restarting the flywheel.</p>

      <h2 id="partners">Partners</h2>
      <h3>Public Good</h3>
      <p>Again, True Freeze is designed as a public good. It is immutable upon launch and
        has no governance nor admin emergency powers. It was developed by Deep Freeze LLC to
        function for centuries. It has been audited successfully, but otherwise will be provided as-is
        to the community for as long as the blockchain(s) it lives on functions.</p>

      <p>To support development and initial launch, Deep Freeze LLC will retain 18% of the initial supply of
        FRZ. This percentage (by design) will rapidly erode as FRZ inflates and forces the
        insiders (devs 12% & angels 6%) to use the primitive too. We won't
        be able to sit back and profit without participating for long (by design).</p>

      <h3>Community Development</h3>
      <p>Generally with public good products like this, a DAO is formed to steward the protocol,
        fund liquidity incentives, make decisions on add-on features, etc. We find this unnecessarily
        centralizing. Yes, many people participate in DAOs, but we feel it is not truly a public good
        unless multiple DAOs and groups are able to contribute to the advancement of the good. For example,
        it would be too centralizing for a single DAO to manage a single front-end website or control
        which protocols are allowed to integrate True Freeze into their yield farms.</p>

      <p>For this reason, we are seeking to allocate a larger 20% of the initial supply of FRZ
        to DAOs, Protocols, and communities who can steward the protocol as part of their
        ongoing work in building web3. This allocation will function as a grant,
        there will be no governance or admin oversight on this FRZ. Any groups accepting the grant and
        failing to support the public good will see their percentage of the network rapidly fall (again, by design)
        unless they actively use True Freeze.</p>

      <p>The largest percentage of the initial FRZ supply (42%) will go to the community of users via an airdrop with emphasis
        on builders and active participants in the DeFi community.</p>

      <p>While the economic theory supports a free market approach to pricing frETH and FRZ, the practical reality is
        that people will earn FRZ in the airdrop and not want it, and people will mint frETH but not want to burn it. As such,
        it is critical that the True Freeze ecosystem be modular and easy to enter and exit at different points. So 20%
        of the FRZ initial supply will go to a liquidity incentives program <strong><em>not</em></strong> managed by Deep Freeze LLC.
        Decentralized Exchange partners are being identified to run liquidity incentives autonomously.</p>

      <h3>Decentralizing Funding Sources</h3>
      <p>The hope is that by spreading the FRZ revenue token ownership widely, multiple different groups will form that have different
        ideas on how to build on top of or integrate True Freeze into other protocols.
        Individuals who see the century+ vision of True Freeze can self-organize (or join partner DAOs)
      to volunteer their FRZ to initiatives they want to see (e.g., automated strategies).
    </p>

  <h3>Want to Partner?</h3>
    <p> DAOs, Protocols, and Builder communities interested in support the True Freeze public good Ecosystem
    can reach out to <a class = "detail-link" href="https://twitter.com/freeze_llc">Deep Freeze LLC on Twitter</a> prior to launch. The availability of partners is critical
    for determining which blockchains to launch True Freeze.</p>
